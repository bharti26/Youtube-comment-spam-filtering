I love you guys a lot and i hope this isn't seen as hate or anything, just maybe as a suggestion to perhaps turn it down a little??

This show is getting a bit unclean. I'm kinda upset about it cuz one of my favorite things about gmm is that I can watch it with my younger siblings without being worried. It was a family friendly show. Even though they've been bleeping out the cussing is still like they are trying to become like everyone else. You don't have to swear to get subscribers! No hate (but I'll probably get a lot of hate for this)\ufeff,,,
"Nah, no hate. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more. I\u2019m questioning if I want to be Mythical if being Mythical means lots of sex jokes. Forget that.\ufeff",,,
They're not swearing to get subscribers. They're just not censoring themselves anymore. They're just being candid and speaking like adults actually speak to each other.\ufeff,,,
I agree how it shoud b family friendly. I was a lot more funnyer but now its kind of awkward\ufeff,,,

those ants were so fake\ufeff,,,
Where was jaws the revenge\ufeff,,,
most of these are 0% cuz there where no reviews back then cuz it was 1980 something.\ufeff,,,
I hope this bit comes back. I really enjoyed it.\ufeff,,,
I'm pretty sure 0% is when no critics actually bothered to review the movie.\ufeff,,,
Why is link wearing an old lady sweater?\ufeff,,,
why is this episode 63.4? while the episode released after is 64.3 ? (reinventing fast food)\ufeff,,,

"some dude  it nessasarily, yes it definitely has been more mature\ufeff",,,
Ive realised this much earlier\ufeff,,,
thirdhero actually it feels unnatural because they've been watching what they were saying for six years now and now when they say it it's like they're doing it on purpose and it's cringey\ufeff,,,
They\u2019ve always said they wouldn\u2019t so anything they don\u2019t want their children to watch. So it makes sense they will mature more as their children grow.\ufeff,,,
it has. I can't watch it with my kids anymore. \ud83d\ude1f\ufeff,,,

Beant actually your comment is much more second-grader-ey. You got mad at someone for using a card in the world just because you don't like it and then insulted that person. You also called another person in another reply section a child because they disagreed with you and then you blocked him like a child. Then you bragged to everybody how you muted him........like a child.\ufeff,,,
